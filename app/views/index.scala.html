                                <p>VDJdb is a curated database of T-cell receptor (TCR) sequences with known antigen specificities.
                                    The primary goal of VDJdb is to facilitate access to existing information on T-cell receptor
                                    antigen specificities, i.e. the ability to recognize certain epitopes in a certain MHC
                                    contexts.</p>

                                <p>Our mission is to both aggregate the scarce TCR specificity information available so far and
                                    to create a curated repository to store such data. In addition to routine database updates providing
                                    the most up-to-date information fetched
                                    from recently published studies utilizing TCR specificity assays, we make our best to ensure
                                    data consistency and fight irregularities in TCR specificity reporting with a complex
                                    database validation scheme:

                                    <li>We take into account all available information on experimental
                                        setup used to
                                        identify antigen-specific TCR sequences and assign a single confidence score to highligh
                                        most reliable
                                        records at the database generation stage.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Each database record is also automatically checked against a
                                        database of V/J segment
                                        germline sequences
                                        to ensure standardized and consistent reporting of V-J junctions and CDR3 sequences that
                                        define T-cell clones.
                                    </li>

                                <p>The web application you are viewing right now can be used to browse and query the database,
                                    providing an intuitive interface for database navigation. Additionally, it can be used to query
                                    immune repertoire sequencing (RepSeq) samples against the database and generate sample-level
                                    summary of detected antigen specificities.</p>
