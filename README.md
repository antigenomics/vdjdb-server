**[DEPRECATED]** See vdjdb-web repository for latest version - https://github.com/antigenomics/vdjdb-web

VDJdb-server uses [VDJtools API](https://github.com/mikessh/vdjtools) and [VDJdb API](https://github.com/antigenomics/vdjdb-standalone) as a back-end. The software utilizes [Play framework](https://www.playframework.com/) for running the server instance. **This software is intended for advanced users** -- we recommend using either the [VDJdb web portal](https://vdjdb.cdr3.net) or the standalone VDJdb application with command line interface that can be found [here](https://github.com/antigenomics/vdjdb-standalone).

The documentation listing local server installation and setup, as well as the rest API for VDJdb web portal can be accessed via ReadTheDocs, just click below
