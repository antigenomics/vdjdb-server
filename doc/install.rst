Installing VDJdb server
-----------------------

VDJdb uses VDJtools API and VDJdb API as a back-end. The software utilizes Play framework for running the server instance.

First make sure that you have installed Java Runtime Environment (JRE) v1.8 by running
``java -version``.  Any recent Linux distribution will provide it via its
package manager.  If not, or if your system is running MacOSX or Windows,
download the JRE from `Oracle <http://java.com/en/download/>`__.

Installing binaries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section is intended for advanced users. We recommend using the standalone VDJdb application with command line interface that can be found
`here <https://github.com/antigenomics/vdjdb-standalone>`__.

The most straightforward way to install VDJdb as a local server is to download the `latest release package <https://github.com/antigenomics/vdjdb/releases/latest>`__.

After downloading unzip the package wherever you want, but please avoid long paths and spaces (Windows version is especially sensitive to it).

You can find the server executable in ``bin/`` directory. To set up the server:

- Run ``vdjdb.bat`` file (Windows)
- Run ``bash vdjdb -Dconfig.file=../conf/application.conf`` in your console (Linux/Mac OS)

Wait until the server is started, and go to ``localhost:9000`` URL in your browser to open VDJviz.

To stop application just press `Ctrl-C` at any time in console.

.. note::

	Note that an exception will be thrown in case the ``9000`` port is busy: ``org.jboss.netty.channel.ChannelException: Failed to bind to: /0.0.0.0:9000``. In order to fix it, either close the application that is using this port (in UNIX the
	``lsof -i:9000`` will give the processes that are using the port) or pass the ``-Dhttp.port=XXXX`` (where ``XXXX`` is new port id) argument to ``vdjviz`` shell script (UNIX) / ``vdjviz.bat`` (Windows)

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

VDJdb server configuration can be performed by manually editing ``application.conf`` file in the ``conf/`` directory. The configuration file has the following fields:

``application.secret``
The secret key used in cryptographic hash functions.

``uploadPath``
Specifies the path that will be used by VDJviz to store user's uploaded files.
You can use '~' symbol as a shortcut for user home directory.
Default: ``/tmp``

``maxFileSize``
File size limit in kB
Default: ``0`` (no limit)

``maxFilesCount``
Limit on the number of uploaded files per user.
Default: ``0`` (no limit)

``deleteAfter``
Time period after which uploaded files are deleted from the server, in hours.
Default: ``0`` (never)

``automaticDatabaseUpdate``
Default: ``true``

``useLocalDatabase``
Default: ``false``

``databasePath``
Default: ``~/database/``

``db.default.url``
Points to the path that will be used to store H2 database file.
Default: ``~/vdjdb/h2.db``

.. important::
	Standalone version uses `H2 Database <http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html>`__ for handling metadata by default, if you want to change H2 to another DBMS please see the corresponding `Play documentation section <https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.4/JavaDatabase>`__
	You can also use this database to manually modify user limits.

``securesocial.*``
Refer to `Secure social <http://securesocial.ws>`__ configuration.

``smtp.*``
Refer to `Play! Framework <https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/Home>`__ SMTP server configuration.
